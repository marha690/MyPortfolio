           <h2> About the project </h2>

           <h3> A basic whitted raytracer </h3>

           <p style="color: gray">
             This project is an implementation of a renderer with an global illumation model.
             To make the global illumination a whitted raytracing method is used.
             Whitted raytracing is an backward raytracer with a twist, at each hit, rays towards the ligthsource are spawned to help calculate the illumination equation.
           </p>
           <p style="color: gray">
             Rays are limited to be inside a room which makes them unable to reach infinitive distance without an intersection.
             At the intersection the rays behaviour are depending on the surface material, where different types exists.

         <h2> Mimics the real world </h2>
         <p>
           To get a good result understanding the physics behind light is essensial.
           For a photorealistic result the mathematics inside the renderer must be the same as for the light,
           or close enough for us humans to not see a difference.
         </p>
         <p>
           Since the comutational power is limited shortcuts has to be made, as limiting the number of rays and their bounces.
           Some physical equations are changed for their approximated versions for faster calulation time.

           <h2 style="text-align: center;">My thoughts </h2>
           <p>
             During this project I have learned about different methods used when programing a global renderer.
             I havbe also learned more about how light behaves in the real world and what can be programmed and what has to be approximated.
           </p>
           <p>
             The final result has some major drawbacks.

             Many bad decissions was made during the programming which was found out to late to be changed, example using double insted of float.
             Some additions which is not implemented are classes for materials, right now they are hard coded.
             The process is not threaded and there is no easy way to create new objects in the scene.
             These things has to be fixed to create a renderer worth using.
           </p>
           <p>
             The result might not be masterpiece, but the knowledge I got during the process made it well worth it.
             Next time I need to create something similar I have a good understanding for what to change for a better result.
