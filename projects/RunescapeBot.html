           <h2 style="text-align: center;"> About the project </h2>

           <p>
             The purpose for this projekt is to make the computer to play a game for you.
             To be able to do so, the program analyse images in the client and from those ckicks on objects and makes tasks in the game.
           </p>
           <p>
             The program logs in an account by it self, play the account for a set time and then log out. Afterwards the program will wait for new tasks from the user.
           </p>

           <p>
             The program is coded in C++ and uses windows internal functions to handle mouse movements. To analyse the images an image processing library called openCV is used.
           </p>

         <h2> Image detection methods </h2>
         <p>
           The matching of object are made in two ways, depending on if the location of the image for the object is known or not.

         </p>
           <p>
            With object in a fixed position, like in a inventory, the image in a square for that object is tested by a reference image stored in advance.
           If the images has a difference from each other lower than a set threshold those are determined to be the same image.
         </p>
         <p>
           The other method is used when the image location is unknown inside the cilent. A copy of the searched image is then iterated over the image inside the client and the best match is selected as a match,
           if a threshold says so.
         </p>
